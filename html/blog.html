            <h3 class="title">Travel Trends</h3>
            <p class="text">There is a pent-up demand for travel after the pandemic and more people are eager to 
                embark on a journey ADVERTISEMENT The latest Sabre survey results revealed several key travel trends 
                that are truly game-changers in the industry. There is optimism in the industry as more countries ease their 
                restrictions and more travellers are booking their first trip after years of being unable to do so. Mandatory 
                testing, vaccination passports and quarantine requirements continue to play a big part of travel in 2022. 
                That said, this primarily applies to unvaccinated travellers. Day by day we're seeing more and more 
                destinations reopening their borders and requirements around testing easing or being removed entirely. 
                Indeed, destinations like Mexico and Slovenia have stripped away any previous restrictions related to Covid-19, 
                for the vaccinated and unvaccinated. The USA is certainly one of our most popular destinations since reopening 
                its borders late last year, while we're looking to New Zealand and Australia for long-haul getaways since it 
                reopened to tourists this spring 2022.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Highlights of South India</h3>
            <p class="text">On this private India trip, explore unique and diverse landscapes in the south of the country. Begin your 
                trip at cosmopolitan Bangalore and continue on to the historic city of Mysore to discover the grand royal palace on a 
                customized tour. Nearby, take a jungle safari in Nagarhole National Park where you can spot a host of wildlife including 
                tigers, bears, antelopes, and elephants. Up in the hills of Wayanad explore scenic plantation trails and lakes on a private 
                cycling tour with a local expert. Afterward, travel to Cochin where you can experience a traditional dance performance by local 
                artists. Next, its time to unwind on the tranquil backwaters of
                Kerala aboard a luxury houseboat and then spend time soaking up the sun on the pristine beaches of Mararikulam.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Delhi To Leh Ladakh</h3>
            <p class="text">The downside of living abroad is homesickness that hits you like a ton of bricks. I have a good job and a balanced life. But 
                I still feel homesick, not so much for my family or the food but for the Himalayas. The urge to return was so strong at the beginning of the 
                year that I brushed aside a serious threat of losing my job. I didnt know which home was calling but I was hearing a call 
                 O nadaan parinde ghar aa ja! But as the cliché goes, “When mountains call, you must listen to them.” I did exactly that.</p>
